# Movie Recommendation System

###### **A recommender system is a simple algorithm which aims at providing the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit Amazon (Prime Video) and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you.**

###### **Generally, there are two main approaches that are widely used for recommender systems. One is content-based filtering, where we try to profile the userâ€™s interests using information collected, and recommend items based on that profile. And the other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group similar users together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.**

## Therefore, the main motive behind this system is to simply design and implement a movie recommendation system by using the item-based collaborative filtering system and understand the working or designing behind the system.
